## Exit codes are a number between 0 and 255, which is returned by any Unix command when it returns control to its parent process.

- Success is traditionally represented with exit 0; 
- failure is normally indicated with a non-zero exit-code. 
This value can indicate different reasons for failure.

These concepts apply to all programming languages even if the way error handling is implemented varies between programming languages.

To handle errors in Bash we will use the exit command, whose syntax is:

```
exit N
```

Where N is the Bash exit code (or exit status) used to exit the script during its execution.
